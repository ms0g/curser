# curs>r
A small tool to send malicious arp packets that poison the arp cache of gateway, so the victim's traffic is able to route to the attacker's machine.The curs>r name inspired by an 80s survival horror game in a netflix movie called "Choose or Die" where the game makes the players step into a surreal world of next-level terror and forces them to make choices with deadly consequences.
